# PUZZLER

A custom jigsaw builder app developed by leveraging cool features of Sveltekit and JS community libraries.

## Gameplay

Players can upload their own images and turn them into jigsaw puzzles. Few pictures are provided by default so that you can get started right way!

## Future roadmap

- Planning to integrate AI for image generation based on text prompts so that players can unleash their creativity
- Puzzles can be shared as challenges and achivements can be tracked on leaderboards
